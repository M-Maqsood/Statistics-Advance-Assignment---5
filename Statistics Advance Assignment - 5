Q8. A researcher hypothesizes that a coin is biased towards tails. They flip the coin 100 times and observe 45 tails. Conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test to determine if the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies of a fair coin. Use a significance level of 0.05.
Ans: o conduct a chi-square goodness of fit test to determine if the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies of a fair coin, we can follow these steps:

Step 1: State the null and alternative hypotheses.

The null hypothesis is that the observed frequencies match the expected frequencies of a fair coin, and the alternative hypothesis is that the observed frequencies do not match the expected frequencies of a fair coin.

H0: The coin is fair (i.e., p = 0.5) Ha: The coin is biased towards tails (i.e., p < 0.5)

Step 2: Determine the expected frequencies.

If the coin is fair, we would expect to see 50% heads and 50% tails in 100 flips. Therefore, the expected frequencies are:

Expected frequency of heads: 100 * 0.5 = 50 Expected frequency of tails: 100 * 0.5 = 50

Step 3: Calculate the test statistic.

The chi-square test statistic for a goodness of fit test is calculated using the following formula:

χ2 = ∑(O-E)²/E

Where:

χ2 is the chi-square test statistic O is the observed frequency E is the expected frequency Plugging in the observed and expected frequencies, we get:

χ2 = [(45-50)²/50] + [(55-50)²/50] χ2 = 1

Step 4: Determine the degrees of freedom.

The degrees of freedom for a goodness of fit test are calculated as:

df = k - 1

Where k is the number of categories. In this case, we have two categories (heads and tails), so k = 2. Therefore:

df = 2 - 1 = 1

Step 5: Determine the critical value and p-value.

Using a significance level of 0.05 and 1 degree of freedom, we can find the critical value from a chi-square distribution table or calculator. The critical value is 3.84.

We can also find the p-value using a chi-square distribution table or calculator. The p-value is the probability of getting a test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. In this case, the p-value is 0.3173.

Step 6: Make a decision.

Since the test statistic (χ2 = 1) is less than the critical value (3.84) and the p-value (0.3173) is greater than the significance level (0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Therefore, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that the coin is biased towards tails. The observed frequencies are consistent with the expected frequencies of a fair coin.

Q9. A study was conducted to determine if there is an association between smoking status (smoker or non-smoker) and lung cancer diagnosis (yes or no). The results are shown in the contingency table below. Conduct a chi-square test for independence to determine if there is a significant association between smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis.
image.png

Use a significance level of 0.05.
Ans: To conduct a chi-square test for independence, we need to determine the observed frequencies, expected frequencies, degrees of freedom, and the critical value for a significance level of 0.05.

Observed Frequencies:

Lung Cancer:	Yes	No	Total
Smoker	60	30	200
Non-Smoker	140	170	200
Total	90	310	400
Total number of smokers = 60 + 140 = 200

Total number of non-smokers = 30 + 170 = 200

Total number of individuals with lung cancer = 60 + 30 = 90

Total number of individuals without lung cancer = 140 + 170 = 310

Expected Frequencies: We can calculate the expected frequencies for each cell by multiplying the row total and the column total and then dividing by the grand total.

E = (row total * column total) / grand total

Expected Frequency:

Lung Cancer:	Yes	No	Total
Smoker	45	155	200
Non-Smoker	45	155	200
Total	90	310	400
Degrees of Freedom: The degrees of freedom (df) for a chi-square test for independence can be calculated as (r-1)(c-1), where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns in the contingency table. In this case, df = (2-1)(2-1) = 1

Critical Value: We can look up the critical value for a chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom and a significance level of 0.05 in a chi-square table. The critical value is 3.841.

Chi-Square Test Calculation: We can now calculate the chi-square test statistic using the formula:

χ² = Σ[(O - E)²/E]

where Σ is the sum of all cells in the contingency table, O is the observed frequency, and E is the expected frequency.

Using the observed and expected frequencies, we can calculate the chi-square test statistic as follows:

χ² = [(60-45)²/45] + [(140-155)²/155] + [(30-45)²/45] + [(170-155)²/155] = 12.9

Since the calculated chi-square test statistic (12.9) is greater than the critical value (3.841), we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a significant association between smoking status and lung cancer diagnosis at a significance level of 0.05.

Q10. A study was conducted to determine if the proportion of people who prefer milk chocolate, dark chocolate, or white chocolate is different in the U.S. versus the U.K. A random sample of 500 people from the U.S. and a random sample of 500 people from the U.K. were surveyed. The results are shown in the contingency table below. Conduct a chi-square test for independence to determine if there is a significant association between chocolate preference and country of origin.
image.png

Use a significance level of 0.01.
Ans: To conduct a chi-square test for independence, we need to determine the observed frequencies, expected frequencies, degrees of freedom, and the critical value for a significance level of 0.01.

Observed Frequencies:

Chocolate:	Milk	Dark	White	Total
US(n=500)	200	150	150	300
UK(n=500)	225	175	100	500
Total	425	325	250	1000
Expected Frequencies: We can calculate the expected frequencies for each cell by multiplying the row total and the column total and then dividing by the grand total.

E = (row total * column total) / grand total

Expected Frequency:

Chocolate:	Milk	Dark	White	Total
US(n=500)	212.5	162.5	125	300
UK(n=500)	212.5	162.5	125	500
Total	425	325	250	1000
Degrees of Freedom:

The degrees of freedom (df) for a chi-square test for independence can be calculated as (r-1)*(c-1), where r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns in the contingency table.

In this case, df = (2-1)*(3-1) = 2

Critical Value:

We can look up the critical value for a chi-square distribution with 2 degrees of freedom and a significance level of 0.01 in a chi-square table. The critical value is 9.21.

Chi-Square Test Calculation:

We can now calculate the chi-square test statistic using the formula:

χ² = Σ[(O - E)²/E]

where Σ is the sum of all cells in the contingency table, O is the observed frequency, and E is the expected frequency.

Using the observed and expected frequencies, we can calculate the chi-square test statistic as follows:

χ² = [(200-212.5)²/212.5] + [(150-162.5)²/162.5] + [(150-125)²/125] + [(225-212.5)²/212.5] + [(175-162.5)²/162.5] + [(100-125)²/125] = 13.38

Since the calculated chi-square test statistic (13.38) is greater than the critical value (9.21), we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we can conclude that there is a significant association between chocolate preference and country of origin at a significance level of 0.01.

Q11. A random sample of 30 people was selected from a population with an unknown mean and standard deviation. The sample mean was found to be 72 and the sample standard deviation was found to be 10. Conduct a hypothesis test to determine if the population mean is significantly different from 70. Use a significance level of 0.05.
